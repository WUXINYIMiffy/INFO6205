 * This class models the Newton-Raphson Approximation algorithm.

 * It is an example of a non-deterministic algorithm inasmuch as the convergence (or lack thereof) is very dependent
 * on the value of the initial guess x0 to the solve method.
 * However, if you run it with identical starting conditions, it will always come out the same: it does not use any random elements.
